                  I had a bad experience that forever changed how I looked at waiters from that point on some twenty-six years ago- It happened in Boulder, Colorado at what I thought was a wonderful Moroccan restaurant called Mataam Fez. The meal was the prelude of asking my girlfriend to marry me—which did happen later in the night and she did say “yes” incidentally. Anyways, I was aware that if I put the tip on my credit card the wait staff would get taxed so I paid the bill with my card and left the tip in cash, it was quite a generous tip, it was a special night. The restaurant was set up as though you were in Morocco so it was required to take off your shoes and you sat on the floor with pillows and a small table and the lighting was quite dim giving a wonderful ambience. The wait staff wore costumes and they provided belly dancing and tricks pouring tea, it was awesome.

                  Absolutely not! It happens every day in both restaurants and bars. As others have said, the profit margin on soda is astronomical! Where the possible rudeness comes in is how you are occupying the space in that restaurant while you are consuming your beverage! Restaurant owners need to turn tables and those tables need to generate a tab that makes them a profit. Servers normally survive on tips which are usually a percentage of the tab and your tab is going to be really low! So if you screw up either #1 or #2 or both and it’s usually both, your getting into rude territory.

                  Few years back, a female friend invited me to a lunch without a prior appointment with me. As I was about 1 hours away from that place, I politely declined the invitation. However she insisted that I must came. Long story short, I came there. It turns out to be a family lunch at a middle class Chinese restaurant which I frequented. Her father, mother, brother and sister were there. The food is already ordered and served, and the only vegetarian piece ordered was tofu with only 1 piece left.
                  <img class="answerImageLarge" src="public/img/image1.jpg" />
                  I decided not to eat anyway and told them I've just had my lunch. However the girl, took a piece of tofu and served it for me. Then I had a really bad feeling about this, and I guess you know where this is headed to! Yes, I have to pay for a dinner of a whole fu*ing family and all I had is just a piece of tofu! Lesson learned, I decided not to meet her again!

                    Why don't you refuse? If she treat you that way, you don't have to be polite. Its a scam. I would furiously, loudly, refuse. I want everyone in the restaurant know they are scamming me.
